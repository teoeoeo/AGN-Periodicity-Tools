This project provides a range of periodicity analysis methods for unevenly sampled data, which is particularly useful when analysing Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN() light curves. 

Current periodicity methods included:
-Jurkevich

In the near future I will add:
-Lomb Scargle Periodogram
-Autocorrelation Function
-Damped random walk generating function (useful for creating synthetic light curves)
-A Monte Carlo based approach for detecting the significance of periodicity for a given method against damped random walk synthetic lightcurves.
